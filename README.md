## 📈 Key Models & Formulas

### Road Network (Task 2)

* **Congestion Level ($Y_{ij}$):** Measures the ratio of actual traffic flow ($d_{ij}$) to the maximum capacity ($SM_{ij}$).
    $$
    Y_{ij} = \frac{d_{ij}}{SM_{ij}}
    $$
* **Collapse Impact Index ($\delta$):** Quantifies the change in minimum congestion ($MIN_1$ before, $MIN_2$ after) to evaluate the severity of the bridge collapse.
    $$
    \delta = \frac{|MIN_1 - MIN_2|}{MIN_1}
    $$

### Bus System (Task 3)

* **Bus Stop Coverage ($f$):** Calculates the total circular coverage area ($n \cdot \pi r^2$) as a fraction of the total shortest path area ($M_{min}$).
    $$
    f = \frac{n \cdot \pi r^2}{M_{min}} = \frac{n \cdot \pi r^2}{2a \cdot \min \sum L_{ij}}
    $$
* **Coverage-Radius Ratio ($\omega$):** An efficiency metric to evaluate the reasonableness of bus stop placement (coverage per unit of radius).
    $$
    \omega = \frac{f}{r}
    $$

### Network Optimization (Task 4)

* **Network Density ($D$):** Measures the ratio of existing edges ($E$) to the total possible edges in a network of $N$ nodes.
    $$
    D = \frac{E}{N(N-1)/2}
    $$
* **Average Degree ($AD$):** The average number of connections (degree $D_i$) per node in the network.
    $$
    AD = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i
    $$
* **Clustering Coefficient ($C(i)$):** Measures how connected a node's neighbors ($e_i$) are to each other.
    $$
    C(i) = \frac{2e_i}{D_i(D_i - 1)}
    $$
